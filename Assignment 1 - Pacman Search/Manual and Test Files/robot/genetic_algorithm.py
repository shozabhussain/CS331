    - This module assumes you first read the Jupyter notebook. 
    - You are free to add other members functions in class GeneticAlgorithm
      as long as you do not modify the code already written. If you have justified
      reasons for making modifications in code, come talk to us. 
    - Our implementation uses recursive solutions and some flavor of 
      functional programming (maps/lambdas); You're not required to do so.
      Just Write clean code.

        Here, You'll get a flavor of functional 
        programming in Python- Those who attempted ungraded optional tasks in tutorial
        have seen something similar there as well. 
        Those with experience in functional programming (Haskell etc)
        should have no trouble understanding the code below. Otherwise, take our word that
